# Clicky-Game using React

### This is a game built using the React application.  To play the game, click on any of images shown on the screen but don't click the same image twice. 

### The challenge is that the images will shuffle randomly with every click so you'll have to have your memory cap on the play.  

### The game ends when either the user successfully clicks 12 different images in a row or the user clicks the same image twice.  Good Luck
